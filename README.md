# To-Do App

This is a To-Do application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also uses Local Storage to save tasks so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which will strike through the task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in Local Storage, so they persist across page reloads.
